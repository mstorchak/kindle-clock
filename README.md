# Kindle 3G Clock and Calendar KUAL Extension

This is a Clock and Calendar KUAL (Kindle Unified Application Launcher) Extension for Kindle 3G. This extension provides an easy-to-use interface to display the current time and calendar on your Kindle device. It integrates seamlessly into the Kindle's system, offering quick access to time and date information directly from the KUAL menu. Currently only Ukrainian locale is supported. Since I have only Kindle 3G, this is my primary target.
